	"description": "Burroughs Wheeler Aligner (BWA) and SAM are parts of a software package for mapping low-divergent sequences against a large reference genome, such as the human genome. The bwa-aln algorithm is designed for Illumina sequence reads up to 100bp. This tool wraps bwa-aln, bwa-samse and -sampe modules of bwa read mapping tool.<ul><li>bwa aln - actual mapper placing reads onto the reference sequence</li><li>bwa samse - post-processor converting suffix array coordinates into genome coordinates in SAM format for single reads</li><li>bam sampe - post-processor for paired reads</li></ul>"
